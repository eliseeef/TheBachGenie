Some issues with the data:
- Missing seasons: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16
- Season 11: All got rejected, no winner
- Season 25: During covid.
- Idk what "returned to competition means, just deleted them (2 or 3)


Weeks 1 - 10
There are no outliers, so we'll use unsupervised discretization
Low Weeks 1 - 4
Medium Weeks 5 - 7
High Weeks 8 - 10
Winner

Steps:
- Removed the columns that were not useful (i.e. Ref)
- Removed all references
- Removed nicknames
- Filled in missing values for the outcome
- Removed the rows that had a majority of missing values
- Created just one csv file with all the data ('processed_data.csv')

Instagram:
- Separate into different files
- Change spelling errors

removed nicknames


Generalized Data:
- 'generalized_data.csv'
- I made another csv file trying to apply discretization techniques to the data

- Outcome: If the individual won or was the runner-up, I indicated so. Otherwise, I categorized their exit as the following:
    - Early Exit: Weeks 1 - 4
    - Mid Exit: Weeks 5 - 8
    - Late Exit: Weeks 9 - 10

- With the help of chat gpt, narrowed down the jobs to 71 categories. The map of job to job category can be found in the jobs.py file
- Also narrowed down hometown to West, Midwest, South, Northeast, and Foreign
